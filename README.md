### Concept

Use acceleromoter and gyroscope data to characterize and track your child's abnormal behavior action quantitatively.

Each individual has a unique stimming pattern. We use machine learning to train off of the child's specific pattern of stimming to have an accurate model.

Clinician can review data. Parent has the opportunity to take action if there's stimming occurring to ensure that consistent intervention with the child is taken. Without consistency, a child's behavior or stimming behavior is less likely to improve over time (citation needed).


### How we address FDA approval:
App doesn't do diagnosing or dosing.
App allows insight into behavior outside of direct parental or clinician attention. No potential harm
